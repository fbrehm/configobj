Description: simple but powerful config file reader and writer for Python
 ConfigObj is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer: an
 ini file round tripper. Its main feature is that it is very easy to
 use, with a straightforward programmer's interface and a simple
 syntax for config files. It has lots of other features, though:
 .
  * Nested sections (subsections), to any level
  * List values
  * Multiple line values
  * String interpolation (substitution)
  * Integrated with a powerful validation system
    + including automatic type checking/conversion
    + and allowing default values
    + repeated sections
  * All comments in the file are preserved
  * The order of keys/sections is preserved
  * Full Unicode support
  * Powerful unrepr mode for storing/retrieving Python data-types
 .
 This package contains all modules for Python2
